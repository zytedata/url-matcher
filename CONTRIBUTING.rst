Before opening a pull request, it might be worth checking current and previous
issues. Some code changes might also require some discussion before being
accepted so it might be worth opening a new issue before implementing huge or
breaking changes.

Testing
=======

We use tox_ to run tests with different Python versions::

    tox

The command above also runs type checks; we use mypy.
